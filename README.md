# MolarWeigher

MolarWeigher is a program designed to calculate the molar mass of any substance from a gram to mol system. It offers convenient functionality for converting weights to molar masses, providing accurate results.

## Features

- Easy connection: Simply connect your digital weigher to the program using a USB port. The program will receive the data from the weigher and perform the necessary calculations.
- Real-time updates: MolarWeigher automatically updates the molar value on the screen as soon as the data is received.
- Precision calculations: You can choose to round the atomic numbers or use float numbers for more accurate calculations.
- Complex substance formulas: The program can handle complex substance formulas, such as C6H12O6, and accurately calculate their molar masses.
- Distinguishing atomic numbers: MolarWeigher can differentiate between similar symbols, such as CN (atomic number = 26) and Cn (atomic number = 285).
- Compound calculations: MolarWeigher can calculate the total number of molecules in a compound, such as C6H12O6 (molecule number = 180).

## How to Use

1. Connect your digital weigher to the computer using a USB port.
2. Launch the MolarWeigher program.
3. Ensure that the program detects the weigher and establishes a connection.
4. Place the substance on the weigher and wait for the weight to be displayed on the screen.
5. MolarWeigher will automatically calculate the molar mass based on the weight and display the result on the screen.
